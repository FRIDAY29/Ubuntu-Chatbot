# Ubuntu-Chatbot

The chatbot is 
designed to assist users with technical issues by providing accurate 
and contextually relevant responses. The project involves data 
preprocessing, model selection, fine-tuning, and implementation using 
Python. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the chatbot in 
handling technical support queries, with a discussion on its limitations 
and future improvements.
